# Predicting Credit Risk
For this task we will be determining which model would be chosen based on their scores and how the scores compare when the data is and isnâ€™t scaled. 


### Using Unscaled Data
Unscaled data was fitted into two models, the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest Classifier model. After fitting the data, it was observed that the Logistic Regression model scored 0.5095703955763505 while the Random Forest Classifier model scored 0.6395150999574649. Based on these two scores the Forest Classifier had a higher score.


### Using Scaled Data
After testing unscaled data, it was also necessary to compare scaled dat. Once the data was scaled, it was then fitted into the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models again. The Logistic Regression model scored 0.7598894087622289 and the Random Forest Classifier model scored a number of 0.6384517226712038. Based on these scores the Logistic Regression had a higher score this time around with the scaled data. 


### Conclusions
After testing the two models with both unscaled and scaled data, the models presented different the scores in each. I believe that having the scaled data would give a better presentation than when it is not scaled.
